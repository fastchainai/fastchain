# Design Principles

These principles aim to promote scalability, reliability, maintainability, and effective collaboration between agents.

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

1. **Modular:** Each agent MUST be designed as a self-contained module with clearly defined responsibilities. This allows individual agents to be developed, tested, and updated independently.

2. **Scalable:** The system architecture MUST easily scale both horisontally (adding more agents) and vertically (enhancing individual agent capabilities) as demands grow.

3. **Standardised Protocols:** A uniform communication protocol (e.g., using message queues, REST APIs, or WebSocket connections) MUST BE used for all agents. This ensures that agents can reliably share information and coordinate tasks.

4. **Coordination Strategies:** Standard mechanisms MUST be defined for critical operations, such as leader election strategies, shared memory constructs, task allocation, synchronisation, and conflict resolution among agents. 

5. **Robust Error Handling:** All components MUST incorporate mechanisms to detect, log, and recover from errors gracefully. This includes retries, circuit breakers, and fallback behaviors.

6. **Monitoring and Logging:** Comprehensive, structured logging and monitoring SHOULD BE implemented to trace inter-agent interactions and performance. This aids in troubleshooting and continuous improvement.

7. **Access Controls:** There SHOULD BE strict authentication and authorisation protocols for inter-agent communication and external access.

8. **Data Protection:** Sensitive data MUST BE encrypted both in transit and at rest. Incorporate privacy-by-design principles in the handling of user or system data.

9. **Audit Trails:** Audit logs SHOULD BE maintained to monitor agent actions, which is critical for debugging, compliance, and security incident response.

10.  **Performance Metrics:** Agents MUST BE instrumented with performance and health metrics (e.g., latency, error rates, throughput) to monitor the system in real time.

11. **Tracing:** Distributed tracing techniques MUST BE implemented to understand the flow of requests across agents, enabling quicker identification of bottlenecks or failures.

12. **Alerts and Notifications:** Alerting systems SHOULD BE set up to notify the operations team when metrics deviate from expected ranges.

13. **Reusability of Components:** Agents MUST BE designed in a way that common functionality (e.g., logging, authentication, communication) is abstracted into reusable libraries or microservices.

14. **Plug-and-Play Capability:** The archtecture MUST BE designed to allow for easy integration of new agents or replacement of existing ones without requiring significant changes or impacting other agents.

15. **Dynamic Context Management:** Mechanisms MUST BE implemented for agents to share context information dynamically, adapting to new tasks and evolving scenarios.

16. **Learning and Feedback Loops:** Feedback loops MUST BE integrated so that agents can learn from past interactions and improve performance over time.

17. **Adherence to Standards:** Agents MUST follow industry standards for APIs, data formats (e.g., JSON, XML), and security protocols. This facilitates integration with external systems.

18. **Extensibility:** The system SHOULD BE extensible, allowing for integration with other platforms, tools, or future technologies.

19. **Resource Efficiency:** Resource usage SHOULD BE optimised effectively by implementing efficient algorithms and considering load balancing among agents.

20. **Latency Management:** Mechanisms to minimise response times SHOULD BE implemented, especially in scenarios requiring real-time interactions among agents.

21. **Comprehensive Documentation:** Clear and up-to-date documentation SHOULD BE maintained for each agent, including its role, interfaces, and interaction protocols.

22. **Version Control:** Version control MUST BE used for all code and configuration files, enabling systematic rollbacks and audits.
