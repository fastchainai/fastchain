# Chat Agent

**Objectives:**
- **Multi-Channel Engagement:** Act as a universal chat engine capable of handling queries from multiple channels (including Slack) through a consistent API.
- **Advanced Intent Processing:** Accurately extract intent and contextual information from user queries, regardless of the originating channel.
- **Task Routing:** Determine and forward requests to specialised agents (e.g., the Intent Agent) as needed.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Maintain conversational context and support customisation across different platforms.
- **Scalable Tool Integration:** Efficiently connect with various backend services and tools to expand functionality and responsiveness.

**Key Features:**
- **Modular Architecture:** Separates natural language processing, dialogue management, and tool integration for maintainability and scalability.
- **Advanced NLP & ML:** Leverage state-of-the-art NLP techniques, machine learning models, and large language models (LLMs) for accurate intent extraction and entity recognition.
- **Contextual Awareness:** Maintain conversation history and context to deliver coherent and relevant responses.
- **Dynamic Query Handling:** Determine in real time whether to process a query internally, route it to a specialised agent, or trigger human intervention.
- **Robust Error Management:** Implement comprehensive error handling, including confidence evaluation and fallback mechanisms.
- **API-First Design:** Use well-documented APIs for integration with various channels, including the Slack Bot, ensuring seamless communication.
- **Scalability & Performance Optimisation:** Employ caching, load balancing, and latency reduction strategies to handle high volumes of queries efficiently.
- **Continuous Learning & Feedback:** Integrate user feedback and monitoring data to iteratively improve the systemâ€™s performance and accuracy.
- **Security & Compliance:** Ensure thorough data sanitisation, robust authentication, and adherence to relevant data protection standards across all interactions.

REMEMBER: 
 - Read the Agent Registry design document `docs/agent_development.md`
 - Ensure the agent is implemented correctly, and as a separate concern.
 - Organise the **Agent Directory Structure & Files:**
   - Organize the Chat Agent under `src/agents/chat_agent/` following the new structure:
     - **`__init__.py`:** Minimal initialization of the package.
     - **`agent.json`:** Create or update the metadata file with comprehensive information.
     - **`agent.py`:** Ensure this file acts as the entry point to initialize the agent, load configuration from `agent.json`, and register the agent with the central registry.
     - **`manager.py`:** Implement the Agent Manager to handle lifecycle events (startup, status updates) and integrate with the Agent Registry, Context Manager and other Shared modules. It should update the registry on state changes and delegate tasks as needed.
     - **`task_engine.py`:** Implement the core Langchain chains for processing user queries, classifying intents, and executing routing logic.
     - **`utils.py`:** Include helper functions specific to intent processing.
     - **`context.py` (Optional):** If needed, encapsulate agent-specific context management.
